Studies of trends in health-improving activities show a mixed picture on 
whether Americans are investing more in their health. A recent study finds 
that Americans are smoking less and controlling their cholesterol and blood 
pressure better (through a combination of health-improving activities and 
medical inputs). In contrast, there has been a dramatic increase in obesity in 
the United States in both adults and children during the past few decades. 
Obesity has more than doubled since the late 1970s, from 15 percent to 
34 percent among adults. Among children ages 6 to 19, the incidence of

being overweight has tripled. Obesity is an indicator of unhealthy behavior 
because it often reflects a lack of exercise and overconsumption of unhealthy 
foods. Also, obesity is associated with a higher risk of many diseases and 
health conditions, including hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart 
disease, and some cancers. 
Trends in Health Spending
 Americans are investing more in their health as measured by health care 
expenditure. In 2006, Americans spent over $7,000 per capita on health care, 
up from $2,400 in 1980 and $800 in 1960 (all in 2006 dollars). National 
health care spending has grown more rapidly than the economy as a whole, 
so health care accounts for an increasing share of the overall economy 
(Chart 4-1). National health care spending now accounts for about 16 percent 
of gross domestic product (GDP), up from 9.1 percent in 1980 and only 
5.2 percent in 1960. 
The primary factor that tends to drive health care expenditure growth is 
the development and diffusion of new technologies. Knowledge about health 
and health care conditions continues to expand over time, generating an 
expanding inventory of new or improved products, techniques, and services. 
Medical technology may account for about one-half or more of real long-term
